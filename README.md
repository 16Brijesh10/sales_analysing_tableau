# PROCESS

Here's a structured process for completing the Tableau dashboard project for "The Bike Haven":

1. **Understanding Requirements**:
   - Review the project brief, including the problem statement, dataset, and evaluation rubrics.
   - Understand the business objectives and the key stakeholders' requirements for the dashboard.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Download the provided dataset (database file and budgets.csv).
   - Restore the database into a database management system (e.g., pgAdmin).
   - Utilize SQL queries to merge relevant tables (e.g., product, category, subcategory, customer, geography) and preprocess the data for analysis.
   - Remove any unnecessary columns and filter the data as per the project's needs.
   - Export the merged and cleaned data into CSV format for loading into Tableau.

3. **Dashboard Design**:
   - Identify the key visualizations required based on the project brief (e.g., top 10 products by sales, top 10 customers, sales vs. budget, sales by region/city, product categories vs. sales).
   - Determine the layout and structure of the dashboard, ensuring it is user-friendly and visually appealing.
   - Plan the placement of filters, titles, and annotations to enhance dashboard interactivity and understandability.
   - Consider additional visualizations or storytelling elements to add context and insights to the dashboard.

4. **Data Visualization in Tableau**:
   - Launch Tableau Desktop and connect to the cleaned CSV data sources.
   - Create worksheets for each visualization, selecting appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, maps) based on the nature of the data.
   - Customize each visualization with relevant dimensions, measures, colors, and labels to effectively communicate insights.
   - Implement interactive features such as filters, parameters, and tooltips to enhance user engagement and exploration.

5. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Assemble the individual worksheets into a cohesive dashboard layout.
   - Arrange the visualizations logically, considering the flow of information and user navigation.
   - Add dashboard-level filters and actions to enable cross-filtering and drill-down functionality between different visualizations.
   - Incorporate text boxes, annotations, and images to provide context and explanations where necessary.

6. **Dashboard Testing**:
   - Validate the functionality of interactive features such as filters, tooltips, and drill-downs to ensure they work as intended.
   - Review the dashboard for any inconsistencies, errors, or formatting issues.
   - Solicit feedback from stakeholders or colleagues to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments.

7. **Dashboard Publication**:
   - Save the finalized dashboard in Tableau Desktop.
   - Publish the dashboard to Tableau Server or Tableau Public for online sharing and access.
   - Test the published dashboard to ensure it retains its interactivity and functionality in the online environment.

8. **Video Demonstration**:
   - Record a video demonstration showcasing the interactivity and functionality of the dashboard, highlighting the use of filters and drill-downs.
   - Provide a clear explanation of each visualization and its relevance to the business objectives.
   - Ensure the video is well-paced, concise, and professionally presented.

9. **Submission and Evaluation**:
   - Compile the links to the published dashboard and the video demonstration into a single document (e.g., Word or PDF).
   - Submit the document according to the project submission guidelines.
   - Await evaluation and feedback from the project evaluators.

By following this structured process, you can efficiently create an interactive and informative Tableau dashboard for "The Bike Haven" that meets the project requirements and objectives.
